been approved but suggested by them, so that the undertaking is
international in scope, in selection‚ and in execution.

The underlying principle of selection has been to reissue those
works which can be said to have contributed either to the origin
or to the growth of international Law and the term classic has
been used in the broad rather than in the narrow sense, so that
no work will be omitted which can be said to have contributed to
the origin or growth of the Law of Nations. The masterpieces
of Grotius will naturally be the central point in the series, but
the works of his leading predecessors and successors vvill likewise
be included. The textos each author will be reproduced photo-
graphically, so as to lay the source before the reader without the
mistakes which might creep into a nevvly printed text. In the
case of the early authors the photographed text will be accom-
panied by a revised text whenever that course shall seem de-
sirable. An Introduction will be prefixed to each work, giving
the necessary biographical details and stating the importance of
the text and its place in International Laxv3 tables of errata will
be added, and notes deemed necessary to clear up doubts and
ambiguities or to correct mistakes in the text will be supplied.
Variations in successive editions of the text published in the
author’s lifetime will be noted, but little or nothing in the nature
of historical commentary will be furnished.

Each work will be accompanied by an English version made
expressly for the series by a competent translator.

It is hoped that the series vvill enable general readers as well as
specialists to trace International Law from its faint and uncon-
scious beginnings to its present ample proportions and to forecast
with some degree of certainty its future development into that law
which Mirabeau tells us will one day rule the world.

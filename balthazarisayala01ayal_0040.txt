situation: S 26. In ξ 27 we learn that prisoners and the fixing
and enjoyment of their ransom are now generally left to their
captors, except in the case of grandees whose ransom exceeds ten
thousand crowns. These by the ancient custom of Spain, France,
and lingland. belong to the prince. They must be admitted to
ransom unless there is reason to sear from them a renewal of the
war, for to spare them in that case would be an unjust mercy, as
Saint Ambrose says. Thus the Roman generals at the end of a
triumph put to death the leading captives, who had sown the
seeds of discord and were the authors of the war. But no killing
or harsh treatment of captives by private authority is allowed,
any inore than by civil law it is allowed in the case of slaves; and
a Spanish ordinance i‘s to that effect in the case of captives made
in a war between christiam, though not in a war between peoples
ol different religions: ξ 28.

'We now come to various points about ransoms: ξ ξ 29 to 323

recovered from the enemy land returns by postliminy to its former

proprietary rights, that usucapion does not run for them even
from the date of their recovery3 but minor proprietary rights will
be acquired by prescription against the former owner, not being
under age, in four years from the date of their recovery. And
if a subject loses his own castle by his own fault, and retakes it by
his own exertions, still the king will be entitled to claim it on its
recovery: ξ 33. It is easily seen what a field for the application
of these provisions must have been afforded by the constant border
warfare with the Moors, of which a frequent incident would be
the taking of Christian property by the latter and its retaking by
the former owner or by an adventurer.

ln ξ 35 Ayala mentions and rejects a number ot‘ general state-
ments and distinctions made on postliminy by various writers.
His own position, as may be collected from ἓ ξ 34 to 38, is that
the first question to be asked is whether a corporeal thing captured
by a lawful enemy, not by a pirate or robber, is one of those which
are capable of postliminy, such as land, ships, riding or baggage
animals, and men, whether free or slave. If it is not such, of

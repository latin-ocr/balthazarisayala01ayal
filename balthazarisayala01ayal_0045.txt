treaty: ξ ἓ 17, zo, 22. The rules of saith arethe same for truces
as for treaties of peace or alliance: ξ 18. But it is usual and
right, though not a matter of law, that a slight breach of a truce
which will shortly expire should not be treated as ending it: ξ 19.
The perfidious character of an enemy, though often shown, does
not warrant a breach of saith towards him: ξ 21.

The seventh chapter begins with a distinction of treaties into
three kinds—those which end a war by the complete surrender of
the enemy, who thenceforward enjoys only such existence as the
conqueror allows him—those which end a war on terms, possibly
including the enemy's recognition of the conqueror's superiority
(ut is populus alterius populi majestatem conservem—and those
which are concluded in time of peace, possibly including a similar
recognition by one party. But no use is made of the classification.
A general's commission, even when conferring plenipotentiary
power on him, does not enable him to conclude a peace, unless
that power is expressly given: ἓ 5. Truces for long terms, equiv-
valent to peace, fall under this rule, but not short truces: ξ 6. It
will be remembered that in Ayala's time the Ottoman empire con-
cluded peace with non-Moslem powers only for terms of years.
In extreme necessity the prince may conclude a treaty not only
abandoning private property of his subjects which is in the
enemy's hands, but even taking other property from his subjects
and giving it to the enemy, for the common utility is to be pre-
ferred to that of individuals: ξ 7. It would rather seem, though
it is not clear, that Ayala did not consider that subjects were
entitled to compensation from the prince or the public treasury
for property so taken. WVhen a prince dies who has concluded
treaties in the name of the commonwealth, they subsist both
against and in favour of his successor, whether taking as heir, by
a statute or by election3 unless where things annexed to the crown
have been alienated without the necessary consent of the people
Or of the estates (citra populi vel ordinum consensum, qui ad hoc
’ requiritur), or where the dignity and authority of the prince
(majestas principis) have been impaired, which could not have
been validly done to the prejudice even of the deceased: ξ to.
The last reservation can not have been intended to apply to
treaties with foreign powers, since Ayala, as we have seen, ad-
